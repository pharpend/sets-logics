The guiding idea here is that, in a standard undergraduate course, each
section would be covered in one day's lecture

0.  Introduction
1.  Basics

    1.  Propositions & Proofs

        * A -> B
        * A <- B
        * A /\ B
        * A \/ B
        * A -> (B -> C)
        * If and only if (A <-> B)
        * Direct proofs

    2.  Negation

        * ~A
        * ~~A <-> A
        * De Morgan's laws
        * The contrapositive
        * Proof by contradiction

    3.  Sets,

        * What is a set?
        * \in
        * \subseteq, \subsetneq, etc
        * Set equality
        * Unions, intersections, and set subtraction
        * De Morgan's laws for sets
        * Size of a set

    4. The natural numbers, and induction

        * Peano axioms, including induction
        * Defining addition
        * Proof of associativity
        * Proof of commutativity
        * Multiplication
        * Proof of associativity
        * Proof of commutativity
        * Proof of distributive property

    5. Z, Q, R, and C

        * Invertibility and completeness

    6. Functions

        * f : X -> Y
        * Function composition
        * Injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) functions
        * Invertibility of functions

    7. Set cardinality

2. Algebra

    * Equivalence relations
    * Groups
    * Rings
    * Fields
    * Monoids
    * Semigroups
    * Homomorphisms and isomorphisms
